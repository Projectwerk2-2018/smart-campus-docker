## How to work with Docker

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a *Dockerfile*. A *Dockerfile* is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using ```docker build``` users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

The ```docker build``` command builds an image from a *Dockerfile* and a context. The build’s context is the set of files at a specified location *PATH* or *URL*. The *PATH* is a directory on your local filesystem. The *URL* is a Git repository location.

A context is processed recursively. So, a *PATH* includes any subdirectories and the *URL* includes the repository and its submodules. This example shows a build command that uses the current directory as context:

```$ docker build .``` <br />
Sending build context to Docker daemon  6.51 MB <br />
...
<br />

The build is run by the Docker daemon, not by the CLI. The first thing a build process does is send the entire context (recursively) to the daemon. In most cases, it’s best to start with an empty directory as context and keep your Dockerfile in that directory. Add only the files needed for building the Dockerfile.

**Warning**: Do not use your root directory, /, as the *PATH* as it causes the build to transfer the entire contents of your hard drive to the Docker daemon.
